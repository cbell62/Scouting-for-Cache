## Inspiration
To make orienteering and land navigation more fun by putting it into a game format where users can select courses based on their difficulty.  This app is closely related to geocaching which is a worldwide game of hide and seek with hidden constructed prizes at the end of the course. 

## What it does
Allows the user to choose a course based on difficulty.  The course lays out instructions including a starting point then the subsequent orienteering steps afterwards.  When the user reaches the end correctly the application will alert them and award them 1 scouting credit.

## How we built it
By using Google services, Google Maps, and several Geofencing implemnations we constructed Geofences on Maps which triggers when the user enters the designated area and awards them scouting credit points. 

## Challenges we ran into
First time using Android Studio for all of us.
Difficulty of being able to implement even simple geofences in maps.
Frontend design and data input. 
Transitioning between functionality.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Having the core functionality working for geofences.

## What we learned
Quite a bit about Android Studio.
That Geofencing is a powerful technology but requires extensive code for implementation.

## What's next for Scouting4Cache
Real life constructed courses.
User Accounts.
User created courses that are able to be reviewed.
